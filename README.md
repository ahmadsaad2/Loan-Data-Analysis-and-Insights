# **Investigate a Prosper Loan Dataset**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Prosper Loan dataset and go through the general data analysis process using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.  
This dataset contains information on over 110,000 loans issued through Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending platform, including details like loan amounts, borrower APRs, loan statuses, and borrower income.

## **Why this Project?**  

By working on this project, I aim to understand the steps involved in the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. This work will also help me prepare for more advanced projects that focus on specific aspects of data analysis.  
Using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib makes data analysis more efficient and insightful. These are not just tools for this projectâ€”they're essential skills that I can apply to other data-driven challenges in the future.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**  

**Tip**: Once the data is cleaned and formatted, move on to exploration. Calculate statistics and create visualizations to answer the research questions posed in the introduction. Adopt a systematic approach by starting with single-variable analysis before exploring relationships between variables.

## **Research Questions**  

1. What is the most common loan status?  
2. Which loans have the highest and lowest Borrower APRs?  
3. What factors influence the Borrower APR?  
4. Do borrowers with higher incomes secure better loan terms?  
5. How do loan terms (36-month vs. 60-month) impact interest rates?  

---

## **Conclusions**  

- **Most Common Loan Status**:  
  The majority of loans are "Current," followed by "Completed" and "Chargedoff."  

- **Highest and Lowest Borrower APRs**:  
  - **Highest APR**: Loans with lower credit grades have the highest APRs, indicating higher risk.  
  - **Lowest APR**: Borrowers with excellent credit grades secure the lowest APRs.  

- **Borrower APR Influences**:  
  Higher APRs are associated with lower incomes, higher debt-to-income ratios, and poorer credit grades.  

- **Income vs. Loan Terms**:  
  Borrowers with higher incomes often secure shorter loan terms with more favorable rates.  

- **Loan Term Impact**:  
  36-month loans tend to have lower APRs compared to 60-month loans, reflecting their lower risk.
